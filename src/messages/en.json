              "question": "Is using a VPN for streaming legal?",
              "answer": "VPNs are legal in most countries. However, bypassing geo-restrictions may violate streaming services' terms of service. The worst that typically happens is temporary blocking of your account."
            },
            {
              "question": "Will a VPN slow down my streaming?",
              "answer": "Premium VPNs typically reduce speeds by 10-20%, which is still fast enough for 4K streaming. Choose servers close to you and use fast protocols like WireGuard for best results."
            },
            {
              "question": "Why does Netflix detect my VPN?",
              "answer": "Netflix blocks known VPN IP addresses. Free or cheap VPNs are easily detected. Premium VPNs regularly rotate their IPs to stay ahead of blocks."

            {
              "question": "Can I use a free VPN for streaming?",
              "answer": "Free VPNs rarely work with streaming services. They have limited servers that get quickly blocked, slow speeds, and data caps that make streaming impractical."

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "How do you compare VPNs?",
        "answer": "We compare VPNs using a comprehensive methodology that includes speed testing across 50+ server locations, security analysis (encryption, leak tests, privacy policies), streaming capability tests with Netflix and other services, and value assessment. Each VPN is rated on speed, security, streaming, and overall value."
      },
      {
        "question": "What features matter most when comparing VPNs?",
        "answer": "The most important features are: strong encryption (AES-256), no-logs policy verified by audits, kill switch functionality, fast connection speeds (minimal slowdown), large server network, streaming support for Netflix/Disney+, and responsive customer support. Price and simultaneous device limits are also key considerations."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which VPN is fastest for streaming?",
        "answer": "ExpressVPN is consistently the fastest VPN in our tests with 96% speed retention, making it ideal for 4K streaming. NordVPN is a close second with excellent speeds and better value. Both reliably unblock Netflix, Disney+, and other streaming platforms."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I trust free VPNs?",
        "answer": "Most free VPNs cannot be trusted as they often log and sell your data, inject ads, or have security vulnerabilities. ProtonVPN is the only free VPN we recommend - it's from a reputable company, has no data limits, and maintains strong privacy standards. However, the free tier has limited servers and slower speeds."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between monthly and long-term VPN plans?",
        "answer": "Long-term plans (1-2 years) offer significant discounts - often 60-80% off the monthly price. For example, NordVPN costs $12.99/month on a monthly plan but only $2.99/month on a 2-year plan. All top VPNs offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so you can try long-term plans risk-free."
